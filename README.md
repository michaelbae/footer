# footer in Korean

Footer is a Meteor based, mobile-ready, web application that provides daily new articles and their most upvoted comments.
For me as a football fan reading day-to-day news is very repetitive. Same transfer gossips... 
But always reading other sports fan's comments is so much fun. 
Naver, the most popular website provies a sports section...and I want to make a simple web app from it.
Find out how I did below.

FYI, this was one-day hacking project

### Version
1.0.0

### Tech

Footer uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Meteor] - very easy web app framework that controls from front to back
* [Kimono] - web crawler that creates data endpoint
* [Javascript, css, html] -the usual suspects
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

### Installation

```sh
$ install meteor, https://www.meteor.com/
$ git clone [git-repo-url] footer
$ cd footer-Korean
$ meteor
$ visit localhost:3000
```
